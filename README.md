Running in Dev Environment:
1) cd YOUR_APPLICATION
2) npm install
3) npm start

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.

You can install any dependencies (for example, React Router) with npm:

npm install --save react-router
Alternatively you may use yarn:

yarn add react-router
